# Verify.tf

Verify.tf is a Team Fortress 2 UGC roster verification library written in PHP. All you need
 is your UGC roster URL, the opposing team's roster URL, and your console `status` output,
 for it to tell you who is rostered and who is not. 

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/jackyliang/Verify.tf.git

## Usage

### Import it

Import `Verify.tf` to your project using:
    
    require_once("Verify.php");
    
### Initialize it 
    
Create a new Verify instance where `$ourURL` is your team's UGC URL, `$theirURL`
is the opposing team's UGC URL, and `$status` is the output you get when you type
in `status` in the console in-game:

    $ourURL = 'http://www.ugcleague.com/team_page.cfm?clan_id=8838';
    $theirURL = 'http://www.ugcleague.com/team_page.cfm?clan_id=8837';
    
    $status = '
    # userid name                uniqueid            connected ping loss state
    #    354 "tjsharky"          [U:1:195209528]     18:31       64    0 active
    #    368 "sike!"             [U:1:128235184]     03:21       76    0 active
    ..
    ..
    #    363 "Muffin Man1"       [U:1:202548789]     12:00      111    0 active
    #    370 "OpTic loop"        [U:1:62145982]      00:39       63    0 active
    ';

    $verify = new Verify($ourURL, $theirURL, $status);
